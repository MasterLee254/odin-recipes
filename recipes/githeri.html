        recipe to make githeri.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups dried maize (corn kernels) or 2 cans of whole 
            kernel corn (drained)</li>
        <li>2 cups dried beans (red kidney beans or any preferred 
            type) or 2 cans of beans (drained)</li>
        <li>2 large onions, chopped</li>
        <li>3-4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1-2 inches ginger, minced</li>
        <li>3 large tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>2-3 carrots, diced</li>
        <li>1-2 green bell peppers, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh or frozen peas (optional)</li>
        <li>2-3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro or coriander for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <p></p>

    <h3>Preparation Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For dried maize and beans: Soak them separately overnight. 
            The next day, drain and rinse them.</li>
        <li>For canned maize and beans: Simply drain and rinse them.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, combine the soaked maize and beans.</li>
        <li>Add enough water to cover the maize and beans by about an inch.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer until 
                the maize and beans are tender. This could take about 1-2 hours 
                for dried maize and beans. If using canned, this step is quicker, 
                about 20-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a separate large pan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onions and saut√© until they are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and ginger, and cook for another 1-2 minutes 
            until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the ground cumin, curry powder, and paprika to the pan. Stir 
            well to combine and let the spices cook for about a minute.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften and start 
            to break down into a sauce.</li>
        <li>Add the diced carrots, green bell peppers, and peas (if using) 
            to the pan. Cook for a few minutes until the vegetables begin 
            to soften.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked maize and beans to the pan, mixing well to 
            combine with the vegetables and spices.</li>
        <li>Add salt to taste and a little water if needed to create 
            a slightly saucy consistency.</li>
        <li>Let the mixture simmer on low heat for about 15-20 minutes, 
            allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh cilantro or coriander.</li>
        <li>Serve hot, either on its own or with a side of chapati, 
            rice, or any preferred accompaniment.</li>
    </ol>

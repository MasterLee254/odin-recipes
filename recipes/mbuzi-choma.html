    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Mbuzi choma is a Swahili term that translates to grilled goat in English.
        It refers to a popular East African dish where goat meat is marinated 
        with various spices and then grilled over an open flame until tender and 
        flavorful</p>

    <p>The processof preparing mbuzi choma typically involves cleaning and seasoning
         the goat meat with a blend of spices such as salt, black pepper, garlic, 
         cumin, and coriander. The meat is the left to marinate for some time to 
        allow the flavors to infuse</p>

    <p>Once marinated, the goat meat is skewered and grilled over charcoal or an 
        open flame until it is cooked to perfection. The grilling process gives the 
        meat a smoky flavor and a charred exterior while keeping it juicy and tender 
        on the inside</p>

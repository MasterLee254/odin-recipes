    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500g beef, chicken, or goat, cut into 
            chunks (optional for a vegetarian version)</li>
        <li>2 cups basmati rice, rinsed</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1-2 inches ginger, minced
        </li>
        <li>2-3 tablespoons vegetable oil or ghee</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>5-6 cardamom pods</li>
        <li>5-6 cloves
        </li>
        <li>1-2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric (optional, for color)</li>
        <li>1-2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>2 large tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>2-3 potatoes, peeled and cubed (optional)</li>
        <li>4 cups beef, chicken, or vegetable broth (or water)</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro for garnish</li>       
    </ul>

    <h3>Preparation Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the 
            water runs clear. This helps to remove excess starch 
            and prevent the rice from becoming sticky.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, heat the oil or ghee over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the meat and cook until browned on all sides. 
            Remove and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same pot, add the chopped onions and saut√© 
            until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and ginger, and cook for 
            another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, cloves, 
            ground cumin, ground coriander, ground black pepper, 
            and bay leaves.</li>
        <li>Stir well and let the spices toast for a minute 
            to release their aromas.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften and 
            start to break down.
        </li>
        <li>If using potatoes, add them now and stir to coat with the spices.</li>
        <li>Add the rinsed rice to the pot and stir to coat the grains 
            with the spices.</li>
        <li>Return the browned meat to the pot (if using).</li>
        <li>Pour in the broth or water and add salt to taste. Stir well.</li>
        <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover 
            the pot with a tight-fitting lid.</li>
        <li>Let the pilau simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the 
            rice is cooked and has absorbed all the liquid. 
            Avoid lifting the lid during cooking to ensure the 
            rice steams properly.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is cooked, turn off the heat and let the pot sit, covered, 
            for an additional 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>emove the lid and fluff the rice gently with a fork.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh cilantro.</li>
        <li>Serve hot, with a side of kachumbari (a fresh tomato and 
            onion salad) or a simple vegetable dish.</li>
    </ol>
